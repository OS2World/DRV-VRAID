    SCSI Optimizer - Driver Dokumentation


DESCRIPTION

    SCSIOpt is a simple OS/2 filter driver to modify some performance
    related mode pages of your SCSI devices.

    Source code  is included to serve  as  a sample how  to  write a
    16bit driver.

CAUTION

    Modifying mode  pages on SCSI devices is  a very low-level action.
    Although I have  never encountered a  totally useless device  when
    experimenting with SCSIOpt.flt you may end up reading strange data
    (which in turn may lock up your  OS/2).  For this reason I decided
    that this driver  will never save a mode  page permanently.   Just
    power cycle your machine, remove  SCSIOpt.flt from your config.sys
    (booting from  floppy if neccessary) and  you are back to what you
    had before trying SCSIOpt.flt.


INSTALLATION

    It is recommended you  have an OS/2 boot disk  ready, just in case
    the system locks up during the boot process and you want to remove
    the driver.  On Warp you may use ALT-F1, C for the same purpose to
    boot to a command line with your orginal Config.Sys.

    Execute DDINSTAL from a  OS/2 command  prompt or double-click  the
    Device Driver Install object  (located in the System Setup folder)
    if your system is Warp.  Change the source directory if neccessary
    and a  selection list will  open asking you   to install the 'SCSI
    Optimizer'.  Mark that line and click on OK.

    Installation by hand is easy:

	Copy  SCSIOpt.flt to c:\ or  c:\os2\boot, assuming c: is your
	boot drive.

	Edit  your  c:\Config.Sys file (i.e.  using  the  OS/2 "System
	Editor"):

	Add the following line to your Config.Sys:
	BASEDEV=SCSIOpt.flt /V		(no subdirectory name!)

    The  position   of  'BASEDEV=SCSIOpt.flt' in  Config.Sys  doesn't
    matter.  If, however, you encounter  problems try top of file  (if
    this  solves  your problems please report  with  a listing of your
    Config.Sys).

    After installation this driver will do nothing but search for SCSI
    devices and display  their  coordinates.  This  will allow you  to
    select the devices you might be able to modify.

    No  modifications  are actually done.   See  below  how  to modify
    pages.


OPTIONS

    Two general options, i.e. option which have to appear before any
    '/A:n' option:

    /V
	Verbose, display some usefull and unusefull information (this
	switch is enabled in automatic installations).
	Without this switch the driver will be quiet except for fatal
	errors.

    /DEBUG
	Debugging display, a lot of.

    One  word  about screen output:    BASEDEV drivers cannot  display
    anything   on the console  immediately,  they queue messages to be
    displayed later by  the  system initialization.  Due to  this fact
    you might not   see any  messages at  all  (if system  hangs/traps
    before they are yanked to console).

    Best chances to see anything is to copy  this driver to the second
    of your  "utility disks" (or installation  disks  if you don't run
    Warp), change  the Config.Sys there (BASEDEV=SCSIOpt.flt /DEBUG
    and boot from them.  Now you don't rely on any SCSI device.

    If you get  a  SYS2068 at  boot time,  all messages  generated  by
    BASEDEV    drivers exceed a  kernel limit   and nothing  at all is
    displayed.  Ignore  that  error and   use SCSIOpt.exe  to  display
    SCSIOpt.flt messages or change options to display less.


    Adapter selection option:

    /A:n
	'n' is an index, it depends on the ADD order in your
	Config.Sys and numbers all adapter (including floppy
	controllers, etc.).


    Unit control options (used after /A:n):

    /E:(u1,page1,mask1),(u1,page2,mask2),...

    /!E:(u1,page1,mask1),(u2,page2,mask2),...

	'u' is  an unit index which  the  ADD determines.   BTW: these
	values  are  displayed by   SCSIOpt.flt during  boot if /V  or
	/DEBUG option is provided.

	These options allow you to specify which pages to modify.  Use
	'/E:' to enable   features and '/!E:' to   disable them.   Any
	combination  is valid, the last  option of conflicting options
	will survive.


MODE PAGE OPTIONS

    As the general layout of a mode page option is (<unit index>,<page
    number>,<mask>) you have three values to supply:

	<unit index>	this value depends on the ADD which controls
			a unit.  Enable SCSIOpt's option '/V' and you
			will see messages telling what indexes were
			found.

	<page number>	tells SCSIOpt which page to change

	<mask>		tells SCSIOpt which features of a mode page to
			enable/disable.  This is a bit-coded value
			(but decimal...).

	page	bit(2^x) description (enable/disable ...)

	2	0	... disconnect because of empty (read) or full
			(write) buffers
	2	1	... inactive bus timeout
	2	2	... disconnect timeout
	2	3	... connect timeout

	8	0	... write cache
	8	1	... read cache
	8	2	... prefetch
	8	3	... higher importance of prefected data than
			regular data

	10	0	... tagged queuing
	10	1	... unrestricted command reordering

	13	<all>	... seconds until CD-ROM stops spinning (up to
			    1920 supported (= 32 minutes)) [this is *not*
			    bit-coded!]


    Hint: if you set 'page'  to a supported value  and 'mask' to  zero
    SCSIOpt   will read  that page and    test whether it has  SCSI-II
    layout.  If you add '/V' to your command line  it will display the
    current settings, too!


SUPPORT PROGRAMS

    SCSIOpt.flt   contains    a simple   IOCtl   interface   to  allow
    applications to retrieve  messages displayed at  boot time.  It is
    described in dskpfpub.h and used by SCSIOpt.exe.

    Just execute SCSIOpt without parameters  and it will display those
    messages.  Very simple.


TESTED EQUIPMENT

    I added  a list of option which  were tested with my devices here.
    Keep in mind that in SCSI many things are free to support, so even
    with a newer device you might have less options to change.

    If  you happen to  know a vendor unique mode  page  that you think
    should  be  modified: please mail vendor  string,  device and mode
    page description.

TODO LIST

    - Ideas from YOU?

    - remove SCSIOpt.flt   from memory  to save  some   KB of  memory.
      Perhaps  switched on or   off  with a parameter  (/V  -  keep in
      memory?).

    - Keep SCSIOpt.flt  in  memory and write a  simple  .EXE to change
      values at any  time.  But this is the   same I already  did with
      ASPI Router for OS/2  and scache.exe (see aspi01.zip or higher).
      Pro:  it would  demonstrate  a complete  filter; Con: it's  more
      dangerous to change at runtime as at  boot time (a SCSI bus hang
      or reset affects all devices on that bus).

    - easier user  interface to select which pages  and how to modify.
      I'm most certainly not satisfied with the current solution.

    - Use Daniela Engert's description to make  this driver full 32bit
      without  mwdd32.zip.   Nice   exercise and would   support  more
      compilers.


COMPILING

    What do you need?

    - IBM's DDK for OS/2:

	available     from   http://service.boulder.ibm.com/ddk/ after
	registration at no charge.

    - a 16bit C compiler

	supported out of the box  are Micro Soft C  5.1 - 7.0 (request
	C7OS2.ZIP to get those OS/2 files  Micro Soft removed from the
	7.0 release) and WatCom C 10.0 and higher.

	IMHO Visual C 1.x should work, too; but you would have to use
	a MDOS session.

	You should be able to use any other 16bit compiler for OS/2
	or DOS, but would have to make the modifications yourself.

    - a 16bit assembler

	the DDK  ships with  MASM 5.1 and  ALP.  Makefiles  are mostly
	written for MASM, but TASM or (brrr) WASM should be possible.

	It's  only a  single file  if you  don't  plan to  rebuild the
	support libraries supplied by the DDK.

    - DMake

	DMake    3.8  and  4.0   are   available  as  dmake38.zip  and
	dmake40o.zip.  Porting to a GNU Make compatible tool shouldn't
	be too much work.

    Actually compiling

    - setup your compiler (PATH and INCLUDE files)
    - extract long arithmetik support routines (see Makefile)
    - edit Makefile (path to DDK)
    - type 'DMake debug all'

    Debugging

    - Debugging device  drivers is documented  in  the DDK.   It's not
      complicated but you need some time to get used to it, especially
      if you  plan  to  use a  simple   terminal (as I  like   to do).
      Expirience with DEBUG or SYMDEB is helpfull.
