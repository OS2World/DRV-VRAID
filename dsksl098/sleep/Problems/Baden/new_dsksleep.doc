    Disk Sleeper Filter - Driver Documentation

Description

    Disk Sleeper Filter is a filter driver to stop your _SCSI_ disks
    while you're doing something else than working with your computer.

Installation

    Make a backup of your system.  You should not need it, but better
    safe than sorry...

    It is recommended you have an OS/2 boot disk ready, just in case the
    system locks up during the boot process and you want to remove the
    driver.  On Warp you may use use ALT-F1, C for the same purpose to
    boot to a command line with your original Config.Sys.

    Execute DDINSTAL from a OS/2 command prompt or double-click the
    Device Driver Install object (located in the System Setup folder) if
    your system is Warp.  Change the source directory if necessary and a
    selection list will open asking you to install the 'SCSI Disk
    Sleeper'.  Mark that line and click on OK.  Reboot your machine.

    Installation by hand is easy:

        Copy DSKSLEEP.FLT to c:\ or c:\os2\boot, assuming c: is your
        boot drive.

        Edit your C:\Config.Sys file (i.e. using the OS/2 "System
        Editor"):

        Add the following line to your Config.Sys:  
        BASEDEV=DSKSLEEP.FLT /V  (no subdirectory name!)

    The position of 'BASEDEV=DSKSLEEP.FLT' in Config.Sys doesn't matter.
    If, however, you encounter problems try top of file (if this solves
    your problems please report with a listing of your Config.Sys).

    WARNING:  as this piece of software accesses vital parts of your
    system (without disks there is not much to do :), it is recommended
    to use the '/DEBUG:1' (see below) switch at least once.  If this
    succeeds, use 'dsl' to set a really short timeout (i.e. 3 minutes),
    let the disks be stopped, and do any access to restart them (click 
    on WPS, open folders, etc.).

    If both test complete successfully you should regard DSKSleep as a
    working piece of software on your computer.

    If the first try to restart a disk isn't successful, DSKSleep will
    beep and do a retry.  If that retry fails, DSKSleep will beep and do
    a retry.  If that retry fails, ...  If your beeping machine hangs on
    disk restart, you know where it comes from.  <g>



Advanced Power Management (APM)

    Beginning with version 0.98, DSKSleep is APM aware.  This means that
    whenever your machine goes into APM Suspend, DSKSleep will
    immediately stop all disks.

    For this APM support, you need the following prerequisites:

    - a BIOS with APM support enabled
    - a timeout defined for Suspend mode in the BIOS
    - APM.SYS loaded in C:\Config.Sys

    If you encounter problems you may disable APM support via option
    '/!APM'.  If you don't like the timeout feature and want to totally
    rely on APM, set a very long timeout value via the '/T:<min>'
    option.



Options

    /V
        Verbose, display some useful and non usefull information (this
        switch is always enabled in the unregistered version)

    /SR
        Shutdown Restart:  some BIOSes may not be able to handle a
        stopped device when they do their initial scan.  They may have a
        'Send START command' setting to solve this problem, but if they
        don't, try '/SR'.  It will stop DSKSleep from stopping a disk
        once the shutdown started and restart any disk still sleeping
        when shutdown ended.

    /DEBUG
        Debugging display

    /DEBUG:1
        Debugging display and start/stop all devices once when driver is
        loading.  Devices excluded with /!UT aren't tested.

        This option requires certain support from the installed ADDs and
        may not work with all of them.  Mostly know that trying this
        option in systems with SYM8XX.ADD before version 4.09 may hang.
        If you encounter this hang and want to do a test:  modify
        installation or utility disks to include DSKSleep, boot from
        those disks, wait a disk to get stopped and try a 'dir x:'  to
        restart it.

    /UT:(a1,u1,min1),(a2,u2,min2)
        List of disks with special timeout needs.  You may exclude the
        'min' value (or set it zero), in this case, the default
        (possibly changed via '/T:') is used.

    /!UT:(a1,u1),(a2,u2)
        List of disks to exclude from sleeping.  They are added to
        internal tables, but never stopped.  Use IOCtl (as in dsl.exe)
        to enable sleeping on these disks.

    /T:<min>
        Set sleeping time to <min> minutes.  Default:  30 minutes.
        Remember that starting a disk drive means stress for its
        mechanical parts and do not set this time too low.  Maximum time
        to set via '/T:<min>' is 1092 minutes (about 18 hours).

    /!APM
        Disable APM support


    The 'a' and 'u' values in above options are indices.  'a' depends on
    the ADD order in Config.Sys and numbers all adapters (including
    floppy controllers, etc.).  'u' is an unit index which the ADD
    determines.  BTW:  these are the same values as dsl.exe displays if
    executed without parameters.

    Examples:

        Stop first disk on adapter 1 after 20 minutes, second disk on
        that adapter after 15 minutes.  All other disks will be stopped
        after 30 minutes (the default value):

        BASEDEV=dsksleep.flt /UT:(1,0,20),(1,1,15)


        Don't stop first disk on adapter 2, all other disks shall be
        stopped after 60 minutes:

        BASEDEV=dsksleep.flt /!UT:(2,0) /T:60


        Using an explicit list of devices, specify default timeout for
        all of them.  Note that this command line does nothing usefull:

        BASEDEV=dsksleep.flt /UT:(1,0),(1,2),(1,3)


    One word about screen output:  BASEDEV drivers cannot display
    anything on the console immediately, they queue messages to be
    displayed later by the system initialization.  Due to this fact, you
    might not see any messages at all (if system hangs/traps before they
    are yanked to console).

    The best chance to see anything is to copy this driver to the second
    of your "utility disks" (or installation disks if you don't run
    Warp), change the Config.Sys there, (BASEDEV=dsksleep.flt /DEBUG:1),
    and boot from them.  Now you don't rely on any hard disk.

    Another way is to use 'dsl -m' to display all messages long after
    the boot completed.  But this implies that DSKSleep can be loaded
    without traps or hangs.



DSL Utility, IOCtl Interface

    To change the timeout values on a running system, a small utility
    named DSL is included.  This thing started as a debugging tool and
    is totally command line based.

    Calling DSL without any options will display a list of devices and
    their timeout values.  The following options may change DSL's
    behavior:

    -?
        Display help screen and exit.

    -c <a1>,<u1>,<m1> [<a2>,<u2>,<m2>]
        Change timeout of unit <u1> at adapter <a1> to <m1> minutes and
        unit <u2> at adapter <a2> to <m2> minutes.  Supply simple
        numeric values for all <> parameters (values from output of DSL
        w/o parameter), insert a comma between adapter, unit and timeout
        parameter (no blank!)  and at least a single blank between the
        first and the second adapter-unit-timeout triple.

        Example, on my system DSL<return> says:

          Current settings:
           Adapter Unit   Minutes
             1       0       40
             1       1       30

        To change the first device to 10 minutes and the second to 15, I
        would use:

        	 DSL -c 1,0,10 1,1,15

        Got the point?  If you find this difficult to understand netmail
        me a better description and I will it include in this file.  :-)

    -q
        Display seconds left until a device will be stopped.  That's a
        value which is resetted to your configured timeout value on
        every I/O.

    -i <a1>,<u2>,<s1>
        Change timer value for unit <u1> on adapter <a1> to <s1>
        seconds.  Same syntax as '-c' parameter.  If you set <s1> to 0
        the device will be stopped immediately (nearly).  However,
        remember that any I/O will reset a timer to it's maximum.

    -m
        Displays boot time messages.  Output will be something like:


            SCSI Disk Sleeper
            Copyright 1996-97 by Vitus Jensen (2:2474/424)
            Not registered for commercial use
            Adapter 1, Unit 0 installed (40 min)
            Adapter 1, Unit 1 installed (30 min)


    Now, if you do not like DSL at all, feel free to modify it.  Source
    code and a header how to access DSKSleep's IOCtl is provided.
    Perhaps it will be nice to have a PM version of DSL?  DSL is enough
    for me, but if you write (or are thinking to write) such a beast as
    Share-/Freeware, netmail me and I will place a notice about it here.

    BTW:  there is a 'hidden' option '-v' in DSL (as in most of my
    programs) it may help to insert it in front of any other option...



Tested Equipment

    DSKSleep should work on any computer running OS/2 2.0 or higher.  It
    should work with any SCSI-related software you may think of.  That,
    at least, is the theory...

    Please mail tested combinations (successful or failed) so I can try
    to figure out where problems reside and make DSKSleep better.
    Especially useful would be information from machines running more
    than simple HPFS and/or FAT drives (i.e.  HPFS386, tapes, cd writer,
    ...).

    Any report should include at least CPU, RAM, OS/2 Version, FixPak,
    File system, SCSI Controller, ADD Driver (incl.  Version), SCSI
    Disks, other SCSI Devices.

    If '/DEBUG:1' fails, a list of screen messages would be greatly
    appreciated.  If the driver loads, please include the output of 'dsl
    -m'.


    I have discontinued to publish all equipment/tester combinations as
    this started to be too much stuff to write <g>.  Thanks for the
    feedback!


    Successfully tested equipment includes:

    486DX, Pentium, Pentium Pro and compatibles at different speeds
    equipped with 16 to 64 MByte RAM.

    Controllers:  
        AHA1542B, AHA1520, AHA2940, AHA2940UW, AIC7860, AIC6360,NCR810,
        NCR8150

    Disks: 
        Conner  CFA 540S

    Beta testers included (but are most certainly not limited to):

        Petric Frank, Jochen SchnÅrle, Thomas Waldmann, Stefan Milcke,
        Herwig Bauernfeind, Thorsten Kowalski, Murat Kenger, GÅnter
        Bartmann, Markus Noller, Stephan Bieker, Nicolai Dufva and a lot
        more I probably forgot or who didn't write any comments.


    DSKSleep was written (and tested before release) on the following
    machines:

        486DX4-133, 32 MB RAM, 256 KB Cache, ATI Mach32 VL
        AHA6360 (Adaptec VL)
        Western Digital Piranha SP4200 (200MB SCSI-II)
        IBM DORS (2.1GB SCSI-II)
        TEAK CD-ROM 516SK
        Tandberg TDC 3600 (250MB SCSI-I, QIC)
        OS/2 Warp 3 c/w WinOS2 (FP#17, CHKDSK32, NEWDASD, protectonly)

        486DX-40, 20 MB RAM, 128 KB Cache, ATI Mach8
        AHA1542B
        Seagate Wren Runner 7 (1GB SCSI-I, by Imprimis)
        AppleCD 150 (Sony CDU-8002 Apple-SCSI + CD800X.FLT)
        OS/2 Warp 3 plus Warp Server Advanced (HPFS386, protectonly)

        Remarks:
            Wren Runner still cannot be  stopped.  SCB completes w/o
            errors but device continues to turn.


Registration

    In general, this driver is a freeware program for noncommercial
    users.  If you are a noncommercial user, there is no charge and you
    should better spend your money on something else from the large
    shareware market for OS/2.  However, I would like to hear from you 
    on which software/hardware combinations this driver was used
    successfully.  Just write a netmail or a nice postcard (see
    addresses below).  This will tell my girlfriend the spent time
    wasn't totally useless.  <g>

    The unregistered version isn't crippled in any way.  The only
    difference is that the registered version won't display a logo if
    not told so via '/V'.

    You are encouraged to copy and pass on the unregistered version of
    this driver, as long as the archive is distributed in its original
    form (complete and unmodified).  Please don't charge any money for
    the distribution itself, exceeding the costs of media, etc.

    You are a commercial user if your machine is being run by (or for) a
    corporation, government, company, foundation, or any other
    organization.  In this case, I expect you to register this software
    after a reasonable testing period (60 days).

    On registration you will receive a key based on your name to feed in
    the regme.exe program to change the startup logo and remove the '/V
    always' mode.  You will NOT receive a new archive.  This key will be
    valid for all versions of the driver.

    Registration fee is DM 25 per key, or the equivalent in a foreign
    currency.  Payment may be made through Eurocheque (Europe) or postal
    money order or transfer to my bank account.  If you decide to send
    this money inside a simple envelope, (I'm honest, but the postman
    may not be ;-) use DM or Danish or Swedish crowns, as I travel to
    those countries regularly.

    Response will be through fidonet crashmail (strongly preferred),
    fidonet netmail, FAX or EMail.

    If you cannot be reached electronically and don't have a friend who
    can be, you may request an answer by snail mail.  Please add the
    estimated costs for the letter to the registration fee.  German
    users:  simply include a self-addressed envelope (with stamps on
    it).  I will NOT return a key without at least some effort from your
    side to account for the costs of the reply mail!

    For all orders:  please WRITE YOUR NAME CLEARLY, as the key will be
    based on it and supply a way to return the key back to you.  It may
    be best to first test an electronic channel before sending money in
    any way.



Source Code Availability

    What do you need it for?
    As an example?  It's written using Microsoft C 6.0 and the OS/2 DDK.
    If you already own the DDK you have many examples how to write
    filter drivers.  If you don't, you get nothing useful from my source
    code.

    Additions:  the OS/2 DDK is available for download at no cost via
    http://service.boulder.ibm.com/ddk.  I am releasing a simpler filter
    driver including source code.  Look for dskprf??.zip (modifies SCSI
    mode pages).

    If your policy is to have any program you use in source code, you
    may contact me, explain your reasons and we will handle this on a
    personal basis.



ToDo List

    - Resource Manager Calls (plug n' pray <g>)
    - Show system activity if a disk is stopped?  Flash keyboard LEDs,
      activate SCSI LED, beep, humm, dance?
    - More?  IOCtls?  Netmail any ideas.
