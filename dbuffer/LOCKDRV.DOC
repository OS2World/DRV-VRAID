                   Instructions for LOCKDRIVE Filter
                   ---------------------------------

         Purpose
         -------

         LOCKDRV.FLT converts Removable DASD and R/W Optical
         drives to fixed disks which are managed by the
         OS/2 DASD Manager (OS2DASD.DMD).

         Disks supported by the OS/2 DASD Manager may be
         paritioned and formatted with either FAT or HPFS
         file systems.

         The LOCKDRIVE filter also issues commands to
         prevent media removal while OS/2 is running.


         ADD/DM Toolkit Installation of LOCKDRV Source
         ---------------------------------------------

         LOCKDRIVE source is contained in the directory

         \DK_ADDDM\SRC\DEV\DASD.IX\LOCKDRV

         This directory will be added to the ADD/DM Toolkit
         by unzipping the LOCKDRV source:

               PKUNZIP -d LOCKDRV.ZIP

         The filter can be rebuilt be doing an NMAKE in the
         LOCKDRV directory.


         LOCKDRV Filter ADD Installation
         -------------------------------

         1.) Copy the LOCKDRIVE filter ADD - LOCKDRV.FLT to
             \OS2 directory of the boot drive.

         2.) Add the following statement to CONFIG.SYS on
             the boot drive.

             BASEDEV=LOCKDRV.FLT /UNIT:0,1.....n

             Where:

             /UNIT: - Specifies devices to be locked.

             Devices are numbered starting with the
             first Removable DASD or R/W Optical Device
             (SCSI Types: 0 or 7).

             Notes: 1.) CDROM and Diskette (A:, B:) devices
                        are not included in this count.

                    2.) The BASEDEV= stmt for LOCKDRV.FLT may
                        be put in any where in CONFIG.SYS.

                        However, if other Filter ADDs are installed,
                        then the LOCKDRV stmt must appear in the
                        proper order with regard to other Filter ADD
                        statements.

         3.) Ready the devices to be locked. A cartridge
             must be present in the device during the
             OS/2 boot process.

         4.) Reboot the system.

         5.) Use OS/2 FDISKPM, FORMAT utilities to parition
             and format the media.

             Note: FDISKPM may show incorrect partition sizes for
                   media which was previously non-paritioned.

                   This condition may be corrected by selecting
                   and deleting the incorrect parition entries.

                   When all the entries have been deleted, FDISK
                   should show the correct size for the media
                   in its FREESPACE entry.

         6.) Media in the drive will be unlocked after a SHUTDOWN
             or Ctrl-Alt-Del reboot of OS/2.

         If the LOCKDRV filter cannot lock the devices specified
         on its command line in CONFIG.SYS the following message
         will be issued:

            LockDrive Filter: Some devices requested could not be locked.

         If the syntax of the command line in CONFIG.SYS is incorrect,
         the LOCKDRIVE filter will uninstall with a SYS1201 error.



         Installing OS/2 on Removable Media
         ----------------------------------

         OS/2 may be booted from a locked cartridge device provided,
         the DASD adapter provides INT 13 support for removable
         devices.

         The LOCKDRIVE Filter must be manually installed at the
         completion of OS/2 installation and prior to rebooting the
         system following the procedures above.

         The installation diskettes can be booted to access HPFS
         partitions or DOS may be booted to access FAT partitions.

         It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that OS/2 be installed on a
         Primary Partition rather than an Extended Parition
         (Logical Drive).

         If you install in  an Extended Partition, and your
         ADD recognizes addtional drives (beyond what the adapter's
         BIOS recognizes) or additional drives are later added to the
         configuration, then the drive letter of the bootable partition
         will change and you will probably not be able to reboot
         the system!


         Restrictions and Known Problems
         -------------------------------


         1.) Locked drives may unexpectedly become unlocked if an ADD
             issues a SCSI Device Reset or SCSI Bus Reset to clear
             an abnormal SCSI bus condition.

             This will be addessed by having the LOCKDRV filter
             reestablish the lock condition when it detects a
             UNIT ATTENTION (Device Reset) from the device.

         2.) Certain devices (especially large optical devices) may
             timeout during a FAT format, which issues large
             a Read Verify operations. This will be addressed by
             the DASD Manager by setting a non-default IORB timeout
             for these operations.

         3.) Devices with other that 512 byte default sector
             sizes are not supported.

             The LOCKDRV Filter does not currently set block
             sizes to 512 (via a SCSI Mode Select).

         4.) There is currently no low-level formatting support in
             OS/2 2.0.

             Support of low-level formatting is being investigated.
