WHAT IS RAID?

    RAID (redundant array of inexpensive  disks)  is the name of  some
    standards  to increase the security  of the disk subsystem.  Those
    standards were first  published  by Gibson, Katz and  Patterson in
    1987.  The idea  of RAID is to use  several disks to build a fast,
    errorprone  subsystem.  Usuallay this is  done  by a special  SCSI
    controller but the possibility of software RAID exists, too.

    Currently the following RAID levels are commonly available:

    RAID  Description	Checksum	data disks  +  chksum disks
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
     -	  Chaining	none		2+
     0    Striping	none		2+		-
     1    Mirroring	none		1+		1
     2    Stripe Set    Hamming Code	2+		1
     3    Stripe Set	XOR		2+		1
     4    Striping	XOR		2+		1
     5    Striping, distributed XOR	2+		1


    Besides these 'official'  RAID levels 0-5 may vendor-unique levels
    exist, for example Mylex RAID 6 (combination of RAID  0 and 1) und
    7, Siemens RAID 7  and many more.   Every vendor has his standards
    and most  standards  are different from   standards  used by other
    vendors.


RAID 0 - Striping

    Using two of more disks data  is written alternating to all disks.
    Transfer rate is  usually  much higher  as a single  disk.  Access
    time remains  the  same.  RAID  0 is  no  real RAID as  it doesn't
    provide redundancy.  Danger of data loss  is greater than a single
    disk  as with a  loss  of a single   disk  the whole  subsystem is
    worthless.  You don't need a  controller to implement RAID 0, this
    can by   done  by a  piece   of   software.  This isn't    a  real
    professional   solution but     may  nevertheless  increase   data
    throughput.


RAID 1 - Mirroring

    A simple way to increase  data security: write all  data to two or
    more  disks.  So all disks     contains  exactly the same    data.
    Disadvantage of this very simple solution: 50 or more percent more
    room for your data and --- in case  of two disks  --- in case both
    disks report different data (write error): which disk is correct?

    Some vendors name disk mirroring as disk  duplexing of two or more
    controller are involved.  Even in case a controller fails there is
    redundancy.   To increase data security RAID   1 is often combined
    with some other RAID level.


RAID 2 - Stripe Set

    Similar to RAID 0 all  data is distributed to  two or more  disks.
    But an additional disk is used to write a hamming code.  A hamming
    code detects  errors and  may  repair smaller errors.    Because a
    seperate disk  is used to store the  hamming code RAID 2  is slow.
    And  because modern disks  use a kind  of error correction code by
    themself RAID 2 is now obsolete.


RAID 3 - Stripe Set

    A performance-optimized aternative  to  RAID2.  It's working  on a
    stripe set and write errorcorrecting to a seperate disk, too.  The
    difference is that a XOR-operations is used as the errorcorrecting
    code.  When a disk fails it's contents may  be calculated from the
    data of all other disks.  There is no dataloss.  RAID3 is fast but
    it's speed is reduced by transfering small, non-continuous blocks.
    Good for large transfer sizes.


RAID 4 - Sector Striping

    RAID 4 does striping on basis of sector instead of bytes as RAID 3
    does.  There  is also a  seperate disk with checksum calculated by
    XOR-operations.  Because this seperate disk  is a bottle-neck RAID
    4 isn't as fast as expected, at least when writing or in case of a
    disk failure (you don't need the XOR-values when reading).


RAID 5 - Sector Stripng, Distributed Checksums

    This RAID level combines features  from RAID 0,  3 and 4.  Data is
    striped in sector-sized units  on several (at least  three) disks.
    Error   correction  is achieved  by    using XOR-operations.   The
    calculated checksum isn't saved on a seperate disk but distributed
    along with  the data sectors.   Therefore there is  no single disk
    acting as  a bottle-neck.  RAID 5  combines high security and good
    performance  and   is  used   for  this   reasons.   Because   the
    XOR-operation  over large amounts of  data  is still something  to
    take it's time RAID 5 is often implemented as hardware RAID with a
    special controller using a seperate unit to calculate it.




    Besides  allowing   to continue working with   a  failed disk RAID
    features  some  additional  techniques  to  restructure redundancy
    after a failure:

Hot Swapping

    Change a disk while keeping  the machine  up  to replace a  failed
    device.   The failed device  is stopped, changed and a replacement
    is automatically setup and filled to  contain the data once stored
    on the failed  device.  There  is no  need to shutdown  a  running
    server.  Be aware that   hot swaaping need special  connectors  to
    avoid electrical damage.

Hot Standby

    Add an additional disk to  the system which is  used to replace  a
    failed device  without sysop interaction.   Until it is needed the
    disk is stopped.
