	VRAID - Driver History


Version 0.70 -  

    - changed the way a registration key is build and checked.  Old keys
      won't work with this driver release and vice versa!
    - added demo key code (timebombed)

Version 0.66 -  02/06-1999

    - build process saves state on shutdown and completion
    - tested RAID 1 code: OK, drive failure has to be tested
    - ignores disks with VRAID partition but no PHYSDEVICE
      configuration.  That way you don't have to remove VRAID.FLT from
      Config.Sys when removing a disk from VRAID's disk pool.


Version 0.60 -  22/12-1998, published

    - added IOCtls to support VSETUP's detection "OS/2 device = Array Drive"
    - Memory is now allocated as "LOCKTYPE_LONG_ANYMEM", should work
      on machines with less than 16MB, too
    - actually implemented registration code


Version 0.51 -  6/11-1998, published

    - smaller changes (WAIT_IS_INTERRUPTABLE)
    - switched from timebomb to "not registered" mode


Version 0.50 -	7/10-1998, published

    - added IOCtls to allow VSetup.exe access disks when vraid.flt is
      installed.  Incomplete but needs some information about kernel
      and OS2DASD working.
    - added "timebomb" code

Version 0.40 -	September 1998

    - fixed nasty bug causing hangs or traps with HPFS386.  Didn't happen
      with simple HPFS...

Version 0.30 -	25/6-1998

    - stable enough to install it on a working machine (HPFS386)
    - changed to HOSTDRIVE -> VRAIDRIVE -> PHYSDEVICE workers because
      setup program happened to work that way (tip: write setup first and
      driver afterwards, seems to eliminate a rework :-).

Version 0.20 -	29/5-1998

    - changed layout of administrative sectors

Version 0.10 -	8/4-1998

    - accepts single,stripe,chain


======================================================================

	VSetup - Setup History


    - add disk space to Mirror/Chain with DnD
    - remove members of Mirror


Version 0.71 -  30/4-1998, published

    - fixed a nasty bug which could lead to overwriting other partitions
      or even the MBR!  Don't use any vsetup.exe below 0.71!
    - doesn't accept partition sizes below 10MB


Version 0.70 -  25/3-1998, published

    - asks user whether it's OK to write to a "non-lockable" disk.  Suggestion
      from pdd@@os2ss.com
    - completely recoded in C++, all arrays/container icons are objects!
    - displays internal IDs in icon descriptions.  Will be used when
      drag'n drop is implemented.
    - corrected Drives->Dump code


Version 0.60 -  22/12-1998, published

    - added code to detect OS/2 devices which are array drives.
      Hopefully this will work in any situation.  The effect is that
      you no longer need to remove VRAID.flt if you want to modify or
      create array drives.
    - displays which OS/2 devices are array drives
    - removed that "beta, beta" warning


Version 0.52 -  24/11-1998, published

    - BUGFIX: the code which searches OS/2 devices was removed from
      0.51.  Sorry about that, hopefully this version will finally
      work (?)


Version 0.51 -  6/11-1998, published

    - modifies PHYSDEVICEs when VRAID.FLT is installed but new
      PYHSDEVICEs can't be defined (OS/2 device aren't scanned at all)
    - BUGFIX: see above, modify all already created PHYSDEVICEs
    - BUGFIX: removed SYS3175 when not specifying array type or
      partition position
    - BUGFIX: 0.50 was published as debug version :-(


Version 0.50 -	7/10-1998, published

    - added "beta, beta" messages
    - added code to *display* configuration when vraid.flt is loaded

Version 0.30 -	August 1998

    - working code
