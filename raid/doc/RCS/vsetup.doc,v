    VRAID Filter - Setup Program VSETUP.EXE

1. Introduction

    This document describes  VSETUP.EXE,   a program  to define   RAID
    drives build by VRAID.FLT on the  next system startup.  Additional
    some settings/statistics of VRAID.FLT  may be changed/retrieved at
    runtime.


1.1. Nomenclature

    As it is difficult to discuss the whole matter (drives made out of
    drives which are known by OS/2 as drives :-) I deciced to put up a
    nomenclature.  Fairly simple:

	- OS/2 devices / OS/2 drives

	  Those spinning things as  you  have know  them  ever.  Every
	  device contains one  or more partitions and  every partition
	  may  contain a  filesystem  supported by  OS/2.  A supported
	  filesystem (FAT,  HPFS,  EXT2FS,  ...) is assigned  a  drive
	  letter.  Whenever at least a single drive letter is assigned
	  in this way the whole device  is declared "inuse by OS/2" as
	  we cannot remove it from the system without affecting OS/2's
	  operation in  some way (this isn't the  whole story: the WPS
	  accesses it,   if  you boot to PM-only    the drive  may  be
	  "free").

	- PHYSDEVICE

	  Whenever a device contains a VRAID partition (partition type
	  0x7C if you wonder) it is called  a PHYSDEVICE.  PHYSDEVICEs
	  are hidden by VRAID.FLT and PHYSDEVICEs may become part of...

	- ARRAY DRIVE (Single, Striping, Chaining, Mirror, ...)

	  ARRAY  DRIVEs are build from  PHYSDEVICEs and may be part of
	  other  ARRAY  DRIVEs,  building   a  freely   definable disk
	  structure.  The  topmost ARRAY DRIVE  is reported to OS/2 by
	  VRAID.FLT and accessible by FDISK as  a whole if that driver
	  is loaded.



2. Main Window

    That's the window you see when  you start VSETUP.EXE.  It contains
    an action log and a menu bar to select tasks.


2.1. File Menu

    This menu let you save or print the contents of the action log.

    --- beta --- beta --- beta --- beta --- beta --- beta --- beta ---

    None of the choices in the file menu are currently implemented.

    --- beta --- beta --- beta --- beta --- beta --- beta --- beta ---


2.2. Edit Menu

    Entries "Cut", "Copy" and "Paste" interact with the action log and
    the clipboard (same  actions as the usual  system keys which work,
    too), "Clear log" clears the action log.


2.3. Driver Menu

    The menu  is only enabled if  an  installed VRAID.FLT is detected.
    Choices are to add the driver version  or it's startup messages to
    the action log.


2.4. Drives Menu

    This menu  contains   the entry   "Setup" which opens   the  Drive
    Definition Window (see 3.) and a "Dump..." choice.

    Seleting "Dump..." opens a dialog where you can select which drive
    to dump.   Possible selections are the  physical disks as known by
    OS/2 (index 0  - n-1)  and the value   "-1", meaning  to dump  all
    physical disks.


2.5. Help

    The  only choice here  is   to display version  information  about
    VSETUP.EXE itself.




3. Drive Definition Window


    Whenever  you select  Drives->Setup   a new  windows    opens.  It
    displays a container  showing   all drives found  by   VSETUP.EXE.
    Drives are found by quering VRAID.FLT (if installed) and OS/2.

    Existing arrays are displayed  in  tree view showing which  arrays
    are  made  from which  physical  devices.  There  are several icon
    types showing different device types.  They are:

    - 3D look grey boxes (OS/2 devices)

      They are  physical devices known to OS/2  but  not inuse by OS/2
      (mostly  because there  are  no partitions or no  OS/2-supported
      filesystems on them).  You  may create a  PHYSDEVICE of them and
      afterwards use them to build a new array.

    - 3D look white boxes (OS/2 devices inuse by OS/2)

      Physical devices known to OS/2 *and* inuse by  OS/2 (there is at
      least one partition and  an OS/2-supported filesystem resides in
      it).  You can't build a drive array from this type.

      To  enable VSETUP.EXE to  access those devices do the following:
      run FDISK and remove partitions used by OS/2 --- OR --- if there
      is some free space --- reboot without that particular filesystem
      support ---  OR --- boot a PM-only  system (the WPS accesses all
      filesystems at startup) and rerun VSETUP.EXE.

    - 2D drive with grey front (PHYSDEVICE)

      A PHYSDEVICE,  a drive where a VRAID  partition  resides.  Those
      icons build or can be used to build an array.

    - 2D drive with grey front and red cross (missing PHYSDEVICE)

      A  PHYSDEVICE  which is known  to  be part of  an  array  but is
      missing  from this computer.    Array is  in state "failure"  or
      "error".

    - 2D drive with white front (PHYSDEVICE, ARRAY inuse by OS/2)

      A PHYSDEVICE  being part of an array  but the  array is inuse by
      OS/2  and must not be modified.   This  icon shouldn't appear in
      VSETUP 0.51 any longer.

    - two 2D drives with grey front (ARRAY DRIVE)

      An array being build from PHYSDEVICEs  and available for OS/2 or
      being part of a larger array.

    - two 2D drives with white front (ARRAY DRIVE inuse by OS/2)

      Same as above but the array is inuse by  OS/2.


    During drive scan message boxes may appear containing the
    following text:

	Can't lock physical disk N, ignore this error and allow
	writing?

    Where  N is  a  zerobased index over  all   OS/2 accessable disks.
    Usually  this means disk N contains  an OS/2 partition (FAT, HPTS,
    EXT2, NTFS, ...) and shouldn't be used (and hidden) by VRAID.  But
    as  OS/2 isn't errorfree  this  message does  sometimes  appear on
    disks which don't have   an OS/2 partition  and therefore  you are
    asked what you do  think about disk N.   Answer "Yes" if disk N is
    free  to be  used  by VRAID, answer   "No" if it contains an  OS/2
    related partition.


    Whenever you create a new PHYSDEVICE two messages may appear in
    the action log:

	"VORDev - missing PHYSDEV mark"
	"VORDev - new PHYSDEV sector"

    Those messages are non-critical, they tell you that you are really
    creating a  new PHYSDEVICE and will most  certainly be  removed in
    the next release.



3.1. Possible Actions

    Double clicking

	Marks another PHYSDEVICE or ARRAY DRIVE.  Marked icons can be
	used to build ARRAY DRIVEs.

    2nd mouse button

	Combine/break ARRAY  drives, build/removed PHYSDEVICEs, remove
	selections done by double clicking.



4. Sample Actions


4.1. Defining an array drive

    - start VSETUP.EXE

    - select Drives->Setup

    - after some drive  activity you should  see 3D drive icons, some
      white and some grey.

      If you  only see white   icons all you drives   are used by OS/2
      (they  contain   partitions and filesystems,  drive  letters are
      assigned), see explanation of icons how to get grey icons.

    - use 2nd mouse button to create several PHYSDEVICEs.  You will be
      prompted for data used to create a VRAID partition.  Note that
      the icon style changes.

    - double click on one or more PHYSDEVICEs.  They will be marked
      (greyed).

    - use 2nd mouse button  and select "Combine drives...".  You  will
      be prompted  for a RAID level  (don't  select levels higher than
      your   registration   allows:  those    arrays  are  ignored  by
      VRAID.FLT).

    - repeat the   last steps until  you  are satisfied.  Reboot  your
      machine to let VRAID.FLT analyse the new situation.


4.2. Destroying an array drive

    - start VSETUP.EXE

    - select Drives->Setup

    - after  some drive activity  you should see some icons displaying
      two 2D drives, those are the defined array drives.  Some of them
      may contain  drive letters you  want  to keep so  be carefull to
      figure out which array is which OS/2 "drive".

    - use 2nd mouse button on an array drive and select "Destroy array".

    - repeat the last step until you are  satisfied.  Use the parts to
      create new  arrays or end VSETUP  and reboot your machine to let
      the changes take effect.
