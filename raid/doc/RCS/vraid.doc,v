    VRAID Filter - Driver Dokumentation

Description

    VRAID.FLT is a filter driver to build array drives out of standard
    OS/2 devices.

    This means you have to do the following steps:

    - Connect disks to any [SCSI or IDE  or ...]  controller supported
      by OS/2

    - Install VRAID.FLT

    - Let VSETUP.EXE  create a VRAID partition  on  some disks.

    - Define drive arrays (using disk space inside VRAID partitions)
      via VSETUP.EXE.

    - Restart OS/2

    - VRAID.FLT will hide drives with a VRAID partition from OS/2 and
      will instead report your defined drive arrays to OS/2.

    - Use your larger, faster or safer disks and enjoy!


    As this is work in process only some  RAID levels are implemented.
    However, it's intention is to supply all major  RAID levels to the
    average OS/2 user.  One day.

    Currently  implemented:  Single, Chaining,   Striping (RAID 0) and
    Mirroring (RAID 1). See RAID.DOC for details.

Installation

    Make a backup of your  system.  You should not  need it but better
    safe than sorry...

    It is recommended that  you have an OS/2 boot  disk ready, just in
    case the system locks  up during the boot  process and you want to
    remove the driver.  On Warp you may use use ALT-F1, C for the same
    purpose (to  boot   to   command line-only)  with    your  orginal
    Config.Sys   (this  "original"    Config.sys     is  located    in
    C:\os2\boot\Config.x, make sure it's bootable!).

    Execute DDINSTAL from a  OS/2  command prompt or double-click  the
    Device Driver Install object  (located in the System Setup folder)
    if your system is Warp.  Change the source directory if neccessary
    and  a selection list  will open asking you  to install the 'VRAID
    Filter'.  Mark that line and click on OK.  Reboot your machine.

    Installation by hand is easy:

	Copy  VRAID.FLT to C:\ or  C:\os2\boot, assuming C: is your
	boot drive.

	Edit  your  C:\Config.Sys file (i.e.  using  the  OS/2 "System
	Editor"):

	Add the following line to your Config.Sys:
	BASEDEV=VRAID.FLT /V		(no subdirectory name!)

    The position  of 'BASEDEV=VRAID.FLT' in  Config.Sys doesn't matter
    for VRAID operation.  But  it may affect  other filters (i.e. load
    DSKSLEEP.FLT before   VRAID.FLT!).    If, however,   you encounter
    problems try putting   BASEDEV=VRAID.FLT to top of Config.Sys  (if
    this  solves  your problems please report  with  a listing of your
    Config.Sys).



Options

    /V
	Verbose, display some usefull and unusefull information (this
	switch is always enabled in the unregistered version)

    /DEBUG
	Displays even more messages.  Not generally usefull.



Configuration

    Configuration is  done   via   VSETUP.EXE.  See   VSETUP.DOC   for
    documentation.



Security, Redundancy

    RAID generally  means increased security.  But  as the only secure
    RAID level this  driver  currently implements  is RAID 1  security
    isn't  completely tested with  all   RAID levels.

    On non-RAID  1 drives  all drive errors  are directly  reported to
    OS/2 (which may or may not survive this situation).

    On RAID 1 drive errors aren't reported to OS/2 as long as there is
    one part  of the array still  working.   However, VRAID will start
    beeping  every 10 seconds if it  detects a drive error.  Once this
    happens  you  may either start  VSetup and  remove the failed part
    from the  array or -- if the  failure is temporarly --  correct it
    and reboot the machine.   VRAID  will detect  a failed part  of an
    array when rebooting and will update it until it contains the same
    data as the rest of the array.

    If you ever intend to simulate  a drive failure *DON'T* remove the
    SCSI cable but remove  the power instead.  Or --  good idea -- use
    some hot-swappable  drive bay.  If you  remove the  SCSI cable you
    may end up with a blown up SCSI controller.  You have been warned!



Registration

    This package is  shareware meaning you  may test before  buy.  The
    archive you  are   looking at contains   a  non-crippled 'level 1'
    filter driver with the exception  of the startup message which may
    only be  disabled in the registrated version.    Test period is 60
    days, after that time I expect you to remove this software package
    from your system or register it.

    You are encouraged to copy and pass on the unregistered version of
    this driver, if  the archive is  distributed in  its original form
    (complete and unmodified).  Please don't charge any money for the
    distribution itself exceeding the costs of media, etc.

    On registration you will receive a key based  on your name and the
    requested   operation level of  the driver.    This key  has to be
    passed to the regme.exe program to change the  startup logo and --
    if you bought more than level 1  -- allow operation of higher RAID
    levels.  You will NOT receive a new archive.  Your key will remain
    valid for all versions of the driver.

	The following keys are available

	Level 1		Spanning, Striping (RAID 0)	    40,- EUR
	Level 2		Level 1 plus Mirroring (RAID 1)	    70,- EUR
	Level 3		Level 2 plus RAID 4 and 5	   100,- EUR

    If you want to upgrade  your registration to  a higher level: just
    pay the difference and you will receive  a new key for that level.
    I.e. if you own level 1  and want to upgrade to  level 2 the price
    will be 30,- EUR or the equivalent in another currency.

    Payment may  be made through  Eurocheque (europe) or  postal money
    order or transfer to my bank account.  If  you decide to send this
    money inside a simple  envelope (I'm fair but  the postman may not
    ;-) use DM, DKR or SEK as I travel those countries regulary.

    Response will be  through Fidonet  crashmail (strongly preferred),
    Fidonet netmail, EMail or FAX.

    If you cannot  be reached electronically  and don't  have a friend
    who can, you may request an answer by  snail mail.  Please add the
    estimated  costs for the letter  to the  registration fee.  German
    users: simply include  a self-addressed  envelope (with stamps  on
    it).  I will NOT return  a key without  at least some afford  from
    your side to account for the costs of the reply mail!

    For  all orders: please  WRITE YOUR NAME CLEAR as  the key will be
    based on it and  supply a way  to return the  key back to you.  It
    may  be best to  first test  an  electronic channel before sending
    money in any way.  If you want the key to belong  to a firm, state
    this in  your mailing (if  you use corporate paper  you may end up
    with a key registrated to  "Obscore Software GmbH" when you wanted
    a private license).



Demonstration Key

    If you are of the opinion that you  won't buy VRAID when you never
    tested RAID 1 support, I do understand this.   Feel free to ask me
    for a demo key and I  will mail you a key  which will stop working
    after some time (usually 3 month).

    To get started you may use the following key (it won't work after
    january 2000):

	User Name: 0100DEMO
	Code:	   065A11F0ED488AC6

    Change to the directory where you copied VRAID.FLT to and enter:

	regme "0100DEMO" 065A11F0ED488AC6



ToDo List

    - allow parallel use of a disk by OS/2 and VRAID
    - support logical drives as VRAID partition (i.e. a partition
      inside an "extended" partition)
    - Resource Manager Calls (plug n' pray <g>)
    - RAID levels 4,5
    - More?  IOCtls?  Documentation?  Netmail any ideas.



Source Code

    Source code isn't available for this  product.  Having said this I
    realize that having the source of a vital  product is important to
    many people nowerdays.  I  understand this (especially when seeing
    the unclear marketing directions of  IBM's OS/2 folks) and you may
    contact me if  your policy tends  toward this idea.   We will most
    certainly work something out.

    BTW, if ever wondered about the  name (Visual RAID Filter) of this
    thing: it's as visual as many products which use this attribute in
    their names.  Frankly, I couldn't make sense to it, either.

    This software is still at beta level.  This shouldn't be noticable

    - you can't create new PHYSDEVICEs as long as VRAID.FLT is
      installed.  See VSETUP.DOC.
    - only spanning and striping (RAID 0) are implemented (so "real"
