    * When an RAID 1 array is smaller than the PHYSDEVs it consists of
      VSETUP only accepts new parts to that array which are at least
      the size of the PHYSDEV (which one?).  VSETUP should look at the
      array size not at the PHYSDEV size.

      First modifications to VSETUP started (setSize() method) but
      were not successfull so far.
