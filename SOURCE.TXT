-= Some notes about the sourcecode for my OS/2 drivers =-


1. DRIVERS

1.1. dbuffer

    Filter driver doing double buffering like used by AHA154X.ADD
    /DBUFFER.  Those ISA busmasters could only address 16 MByte and
    dbuffer was designed to those controllers usable in systems with
    more RAM.  Never released.


1.2. mini

    Sourcecode for a minimal driver.  Used to test features (or find
    missing features) of the OS/2 kernel.  Just playground.


1.3. perf

    Filter driver to modify SCSI mode pages during system mode.	 Most
    notable write cache and tag queue reordering.  This driver was
    released two times to the general public as Public Domain.

    scsiopt.doc contains instructions how to compile this code and
    which tools and compiler versions are needed/supported.  That text
    can be applied to all of my drivers, they all use the same
    tools/compilers (best supported are Microsoft C/C++ 7.0 and DMake
    4.0).

1.3.1. RCS tags

    None :-(  There should have been some as the driver was released
    but unfortunately I forgot to do this.

    See scsiopt.history for histoy.


1.4. sleep

    A driver to stop SCSI disks when they weren't accessed for some
    time and to automatically restart them on next access.  Released
    as shareware, free for private use.

1.4.1 RCS tags

    Some.  See dsksleep.history for all released versions, RCS tags
    directly relate to them:

	DSLEEPv0_98	dsksleep 0.98
	DSLEEPv0_95	dsksleep 0.95
	DSLEEPv0_93	etc
	DSLEEPv0_92
	DSLEEPv0_91
	DSLEEPv0_80
	DSLEEPv0_70
	DSLEEPv0_60

    There are some changes after DSLEEPv0_98 but those are only
    related to DDK changes, nothing functionally.  The latest
    sourcecode revision is compilable.


1.5. raid

    vraid, software raid for OS/2.  Implements RAID 0, 1 and chaining
    as a Filter Driver. The latest sourcecode is not buildable as it
    contains very incomplete work to add RAID 5.  Maybe reading an
    exiting array in non-error mode would work but there is no build
    (easy: just write), error state or fault state support.

    To compile you have to checkout a tagged version, here are tags:
    
	vrflt031113	fix released 13/11-2003
	vrflt010903	fix released 03/09-2001
	PREV010803
	VRAIDv0_85
	VRAIDv0_84	published in VRAID23.ZIP
	VRAIDv0_82	published in VRAID22.ZIP
	VRAIDv0_70
	VRAIDv0_60
	VRAIDv0_51
	VRAIDv0_50
	VRAIDv0_40
	VRAIDv0_30
	ALPHA1

1.6. raid/doc

    IPF sourcecode for online documentation.  Needs ipfpp.exe and
    ipfc.exe.  There are some internal docs, too.  The online
    documentation cotains list which driver and setup program were
    published together.

	VRAID_REL23	published in VRAID23.ZIP
	REL22		published in VRAID22.ZIP
	VRAIDv0_70
	VRAIDv0_60
	VRAIDv0_51
	VRAIDv0_50
	VRAIDv0_40
	VRAIDv0_30
	ALPHA1


1.7. raid/Setup

    Graphical setup program to create or administrate arrays.  Write
    in C++ directly to the Presentation Manager API.  The latest
    sourcecode should not be used as it contains (possible incomplete)
    changes for RAID 5.  Try one of those tags:

	VSETUPv0_84
        VSETUP_82
        VSETUPv0_80
        VSETUPv0_71
        VSETUPv0_70
        VSETUPv0_60
        VSETUPv0_52
        VSETUPv0_51
        VSETUPv0_50
        VSETUPv0_20


2. Support

    ... None.  Well, I will try to answer questions raised about the
    sourcecode but would prefer to do this in a public manner,
    searchable by google etc.  This rules out private messages.	 I
    hate web forums, so don't ask about commtalk or similar.  The best
    solution for me would be usenet, comp.os.os2.setup.storage is
    pretty low in traffik so this could be the place.


3. LAYOUT

    Sourceode uses TABs, a TAB being the move to the next tabstop,
    tabstops are 0 8 16 24 and so on.  Just like any console would
    display the text (type file.c)

    If you want to preserve the layout and are using emacs you could
    use the following snippet.	It's not totally correct as "case"
    labels should be positioned like normal "goto" labels, 2 left
    from labelled code but I never got around to fix whatever emacs
    19.26 changed in that compartment.

; --- I prefer a certain style in all C dialects (C, C++, Obj-C).  Similar
; --- to Stroustrups but more like Emacs 19.25...
; --- cc-mode.el version
(defun my-c-mode-common-hook ()
  (c-set-style "stroustrup")			; bsd | stroustrup | whitesmith
  ;; other customizations can go here
;  (c-set-offset 'case-label '*)
;  (c-set-offset 'statement-case-intro '*)
;  (c-set-offset 'label '*)
  (setq comment-column 48)
  (setq c-tab-always-indent nil)
  )
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook)
(setq c-electric-pound-behavior '(alignleft))
