    Disk Sleeper Filter - Driver Dokumentation

Description

    Disk Sleeper Filter is  a filter driver  to stop your _SCSI_ disks
    while you're doing something else than working with your computer.

Installation

    Make a backup of your  system.  You should not  need it but better
    safe than sorry...

    It is recommended you  have an OS/2  boot disk ready, just in case
    the system locks up during the boot process and you want to remove
    the  driver.   On Warp you  may  use use   ALT-F1, C for  the same
    purpose to boot to a command line with your orginal Config.Sys.

    Execute  DDINSTAL from a  OS/2 command prompt  or double-click the
    Device Driver Install object (located in  the System Setup folder)
    if your system is Warp.  Change the source directory if neccessary
    and a selection  list will open   asking you to  install the 'SCSI
    Disk Sleeper'.   Mark  that line and  click  on  OK.  Reboot  your
    machine.

    Installation by hand is easy:

	Copy  DSKSLEEP.FLT to c:\ or  c:\os2\boot, assuming c: is your
	boot drive.

	Edit  your  C:\Config.Sys file (i.e.  using  the  OS/2 "System
	Editor"):

	Add the following line to your Config.Sys:
	BASEDEV=DSKSLEEP.FLT /V		(no subdirectory name!)

    The  position   of  'BASEDEV=DSKSLEEP.FLT' in  Config.Sys  doesn't
    matter.  If, however, you encounter  problems try top of file  (if
    this  solves  your problems please report  with  a listing of your
    Config.Sys).

    WARNING: as this  piece of software accessses  vital parts of your
    system (without  disks   there  is not  much   to do  :),   it  is
    recommended to  use  the '/DEBUG:1' (see   below)  switch at least
    once.  If  this succeeds use 'dsl' to  set a  really short timeout
    (i.e.  3 minutes), let  the disks be stopped and  do any access to
    restart them (click on WPS, open folders, etc.).

    If both test complete successfully you should regard DSKSleep as a
    working piece of software on your computer.

    If the first try to restart a disk isn't successfull DSKSleep will
    beep and do a  retry.  If that retry  fails DSKSleep will beep and
    do a retry.  If that retry fails...  If your beeping machine hangs
    on disk restart you know where it comes from. <g>



Advanced Power Management (APM)

    Beginning  with version 0.98  DSKSleep is  APM  aware.  This means
    that  whenever your machine   goes into APM Suspend DSKSleep  will
    immediately stop all disks.

    For this APM support you need the following prerequisites:

    - a BIOS with APM support enabled
    - a timeout defined for Suspend mode in the BIOS
    - APM.SYS loaded in C:\Config.sys

    If you encounter  problems you may disable  APM support via option
    '/!APM'.    If  you don't  like the   timeout  feature and want to
    totally rely    on APM, set  a  very  long timeout value   via the
    '/T:<min>' option.



Options

    /V
	Verbose, display some usefull and unusefull information (this
	switch is always enabled in the unregistered version)

    /SR
	Shutdown Restart: some  BIOS   may not be   able to  handle  a
	stopped device when they do their initial scan.  They may have
	a  'Send START command' setting  to  solve this problem but if
	they don't try  '/SR'.  It will  stop DSKSleep from stopping a
	disk  once the shutdown   started and restart  any  disk still
	sleeping when shutdown ended.

    /DEBUG
	Debugging display

    /DEBUG:1
	Debugging display and start/stop all devices once when driver
	is loading.  Devices excluded with /!UT aren't tested.

	This  option requires certain support  from the installed ADDs
	and may not work with all of them.  Mostly know is that trying
	this option in systems with SYM8XX.ADD before version 4.09 may
	hang.  If  you  encounter this hang  and  want to  do  a test:
	modify installation or utility disks to include DSKSleep, boot
	from those  disks, wait a disk to  get stopped and try  a 'dir
	x:' to restart it.

    /UT:(a1,u1,min1),(a2,u2,min2)
	List of disks with special timeout needs.  You may exclude the
	'min' value (or set it zero), in this cause the default
	(possible changed via '/T:') is used.

    /!UT:(a1,u1),(a2,u2)
	List of disks to exclude from sleeping.  They are added to
	internal tables but never stopped.  Use IOCtl (as in dsl.exe)
	to enable sleeping these disks.

    /T:<min>
	Set sleeping time to <min> minutes.  Default: 30 minutes.
	Remember that starting a disk drive means stress for it's
	mechanical parts and do not set this time to low.  Maximum
	time to set via '/T:<min>' is 1092 minutes (about 18 hours).

    /!APM
	Disable APM support


    The 'a' and 'u' values in above options  are indices.  'a' depends
    on the ADD order in Config.Sys and numbers all adapters (including
    floppy controllers,  etc.).  'u' is  an  unit index which  the ADD
    determines.  BTW: these are the same values as dsl.exe displays if
    executed without parameters.

    Examples:

	Stop first disk on adapter 1  after 20 minutes, second disk on
	that  adapter after 15   minutes.  All  other  disks   will be
	stopped after 30 minutes (the default value):

	BASEDEV=dsksleep.flt /UT:(1,0,20),(1,1,15)


	Don't stop first disk  on adapter 2, all  other disks shall be
	stopped after 60 minutes:

	BASEDEV=dsksleep.flt /!UT:(2,0) /T:60


	Using an explicit list of devices, specify default timeout for
	all of  them.    Note  that  this  command  line  does nothing
	usefull:

	BASEDEV=dsksleep.flt /UT:(1,0),(1,2),(1,3)


    One  word  about screen output:    BASEDEV drivers cannot  display
    anything   on the console  immediately,  they queue messages to be
    displayed later by  the  system initialization.  Due to  this fact
    you might not   see any  messages at  all  (if system  hangs/traps
    before they are yanked to console).

    Best chances to see anything is to copy  this driver to the second
    of your  "utility disks" (or installation  disks  if you don't run
    Warp), change  the Config.Sys there (BASEDEV=dsksleep.flt /DEBUG:1
    and boot from them.  Now you don't rely on any hard disk.

    Another way is to use 'dsl -m' to display  all messages long after
    the boot completed.  But this implies  that DSKSleep can be loaded
    without traps or hangs.



DSL Utility, IOCtl Interface

    To change the timeout values on a running  system, a small utility
    named DSL is included.  This thing started as a debugging tool and
    is totally command line based.

    Calling DSL without any options will display a list of devices and
    their  timeout values.   The  following  opions may  change  DSL's
    behavior:

    -?

	Display help screen and exit.

    -c <a1>,<u1>,<m1> [<a2>,<u2>,<m2>]

	Change timeout  of unit <u1> at adapter   <a1> to <m1> minutes
	and unit <u2> at adapter <a2> to  <m2> minutes.  Supply simple
	numeric values  for all <>  parameters (values  from output of
	DSL w/o parameter),  insert a comma  between adapter, unit and
	timeout  parameter (no blank!)   and at  least a single  blank
	between the first and the second adapter-unit-timeout triple.

	Example, on my system DSL<return> says:

	  Current settings:
	   Adapter Unit   Minutes
	     1       0       40
	     1       1       30

	To change the first device to 10 minutes  and the second to 15
	I would use:

	    DSL -c 1,0,10     1,1,15

	Got  the point?  If  you   find this difficult  to  understand
	netmail me a better description and I  will it include in this
	file. :-)

    -q

	Display seconds left until a device will be stopped.  That's a
	value which is resetted  to  your configured timeout value  on
	every I/O.

    -i <a1>,<u2>,<s1>

	Change timer  value for unit    <u1> on adapter  <a1> to  <s1>
	seconds.  Same syntax as '-c' parameter.  If you set <s1> to 0
	the device  will  be stopped  immediately (nearly).   However,
	remember that any I/O will reset a timer to it's maximum.

    -m

	Displays boot time messages.  Output will be something like:


	    SCSI Disk Sleeper
	    Copyright 1996-97 by Vitus Jensen (2:2474/424)
	    Not registered for commercial use
	    Adapter 1, Unit 0 installed (40 min)
	    Adapter 1, Unit 1 installed (30 min)


    Now,  if  you do  not like DSL   at all, feel  free to  modify it.
    Sourcecode  and  a  header   how to  access DSKSleep's  IOCtl   is
    provided.  Perhaps it  will be nice to  have a PM version  of DSL?
    DSL is enough for me but if you write  (or thinking to write) such
    a beast  as Share-/Freeware, netmail me  and I will place a notice
    about it here.

    BTW: there is  a 'hidden' option  '-v'  in DSL  (as in  most of my
    programs) it may help to insert it in front of any other option...



Tested Equipment

    DSKSleep should work on any  computer running OS/2 2.0 or  higher.
    It should work  with any SCSI-related software  you  may think of.
    That, at least, is the theory...

    Please mail  tested combinations (successfull or  failed) so I can
    try to figure out where  problems reside and make DSKSleep better.
    Especially usefull would be information from machines running more
    than simple  HPFS  and/or  FAT  drives (i.e.  HPFS386,   tapes, cd
    writer, ...).

    Any report should include at least CPU, RAM, OS/2 Version, FixPak,
    Filesystem,   SCSI  Controller, ADD   Driver (incl. Version), SCSI
    Disks, other SCSI Devices.

    If '/DEBUG:1' fails a   list of screen  messages would  be greatly
    appreciated.  If the driver loadds please include the output of
    'dsl -m'.


    I have  discontinued to publish  all equipment/tester combinations
    as this started to be too much stuff to write <g>.  Thanks for the
    feedback!

    Successfully tested equipment include:

    486DX, Pentium, Pentium Pro and compatibles at different speeds
    equipped with 16 to 64 MByte RAM.

    Controller: AHA1542B, AHA1520, AHA2940, AHA2940UW, AIC7860, AIC6360,
		NCR810, NCR8150

    Disks: Conner	CFA 540S
	   HP		C3325A
	   IBM		DFHS S2F, DORS 32160S, DPES 31080,
	   Quantum	LPS 540, 730
	   Seagate	Wren Runner 7
	   WD		SP4200


    Betatesters include (but are most certainly not limited to):

	Petric Frank, Jochen SchnÅrle, Thomas Waldmann, Stefan Milcke,
	Herwig  Bauernfeind, Thorsten  Kowalski, Murat  Kenger, GÅnter
	Bartmann, Markus Noller,  Stephan Bieker, Nicolai Dufva  and a
	lot more I probably forgot or who didn't write any comments.


    DSKSleep is written (and tested before release) on the following
    machines:

	486DX4-133, 32 MB RAM, 256 KB Cache, ATI Mach32 VL
	AHA6360 (Adaptec VL)
	Western Digital Piranha SP4200 (200MB SCSI-II)
	IBM DORS (2.1GB SCSI-II)
	TEAK CD-ROM 516SK
	Tandberg TDC 3600 (250MB SCSI-I, QIC)
	OS/2 Warp 3 w/ WinOS2 (FP#17, CHKDSK32, NEWDASD, protectonly)

	486DX-40, 20 MB RAM, 128 KB Cache, ATI Mach8
	AHA1542B
	Seagate Wren Runner 7 (1GB SCSI-I, by Imprimis)
	AppleCD 150 (Sony CDU-8002 Apple-SCSI + CD800X.FLT)
	OS/2 Warp 3 plus Warp Server Advanced (HPFS386, protectonly)

	Remarks
	    Wren Runner still  cannot be  stopped.  SCB completes  w/o
	    errors but device continues to turn.



Registration

    In  general, this driver is  a  freeware program for noncommercial
    users.  If  you are a noncommercial  user, there is no  charge and
    you  should  better spend  your money  on  something else from the
    large shareware  market  for OS/2.   However I  would like to hear
    from  you on  which software/hardware combinations  this driver is
    used successfully.  Just write a  netmail or a nice postcard  (see
    addresses  below).   This will tell my   girlfriend the spent time
    wasn't totally useless. <g>

    The  unregistered version isn't   crippled in any  way.   The only
    difference is that the registered version won't  display a logo if
    not told so via '/V'.

    You are encouraged to copy and pass on the unregistered version of
    this driver, if  the archive is  distributed in  its original form
    (complete and unmodified).  Please don't charge any money for the
    distribution itself exceeding the costs of media, etc.


    You are a commercial user if your machine is being run by (or for)
    a   corporation, government, company,  foundation,   or  any other
    organization.  In this case I expect you to register this software
    after a reasonable testing period (60 days).

    On registration you will receive a key based on  your name to feed
    in the regme.exe program to change the startup logo and remove the
    '/V always'  mode.  You will NOT receive  a new archive.  This key
    will be valid for all versions of the driver.

    Registration fee is DM 25,- per key or the equivalent in a foreign
    currency.  Payment may   be  made through  Eurocheque  (europe) or
    postal money order or transfer to my bank  account.  If you decide
    to send this  money  inside a simple envelope  (I'm  fair but  the
    postman may not ;-) use DM or danish or swedish crowns as I travel
    those countries regulary.

    Response will  be through fidonet crashmail  (strongly preferred),
    fidonet netmail, FAX  or EMail.

    If you cannot be reached elecronically and don't have a friend who
    can, you  may  request an answer   by snail mail.   Please add the
    estimated costs for the  letter to the  registration  fee.  German
    users: simply include   a self-addressed envelope  (with stamps on
    it).  I will NOT  return a key  without at least some  afford from
    your side to account for the costs of the reply mail!

    For all  orders: please WRITE YOUR  NAME CLEAR as  the key will be
    based on it  and supply a  way to return the  key back to you.  It
    may be best to  first test an   electronic channel before  sending
    money in any way.



Source Code Availability

    What do you need it for?
    As an example?  It's  written using Microsoft C  6.0 and  the OS/2
    DDK.  If  you already own  the DDK you  have many  examples how to
    write filter drivers.  If you  don't you get nothing usefull  from
    my source code.

    Additions: the OS/2 DDK  is available for  download at no cost via
    http://service.boulder.ibm.com/ddk.   I am    releasing a  simpler
    filter driver  including   source  code.  Look  for   dskprf??.zip
    (modifies SCSI mode pages).

    If your policy is to have any program you use in source code, you
    may contact me, explain your reasons and we will handle this on a
    personal base.



ToDo List

    - Resource Manager Calls (plug n' pray <g>)
    - Show system activity if a disk is stopped?  Flash keyboard LEDs,
      activate SCSI LED, beep, humm, dance?
    - More?  IOCtls?  Netmail any ideas.

    WARNING: as this piece of software accessses vital parts of your
    system (without disks there is not much to do :), it is
    recommanded to use the '/DEBUG:1' (see below) switch at least
    once.  If this succeeds use 'dsl' to set a really short timeout
    (i.e. 3 minutes), let the disks be stopped and do any access to
