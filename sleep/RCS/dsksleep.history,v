    Disk Sleeper Filter - Driver History

Version 0.98 -	 28.2.2001 - dsksl098.zip
    - APM support
    - removed timing releated error which could fail initialisation

Version 0.97 (internal)
    - source supports Microsoft C *and* WatCom C
    - IOCtl returns IORB which restarted a disk


Version 0.96 -	 23.11.1997 - dsksl096.zip
    - BUGFIX: DSKSleep 0.95 did ignore SCSI adapters which correctly
      reported bus widths (my adaptecs did not).  Corrected.

Version 0.95 -	 22.11.1997 - dsksl095.zip
    - BUGFIX: DSKSleep 0.93 did not ignore non-SCSI adapters.
      Could lead to system hangs.


Version 0.93 -	 9.11.1997 - dsksl093.zip
    - installed new DDK, required small changes in IOCtl code
    - corrected filtering code, did pass wrong handle to ADD
      (= SYM8XX problems?).  Made this case easier to debug.
    - updated dsksleep.doc (bank account, parameters, etc.)
    - added IOCtl to retrieve saved status and sense values
      and updated dsl.exe to display them
    - /DEBUG:1 uses same start/stop code as runtime operation
    - accepts /!DM or /!SM units
    - don't test /!UT devices
    - removed trap if a device test fails and there are no other disks
      to install for.

Version 0.92 (internal)
    - disable device stopping once the system enters shutdown (/SR)
    - device test (/DEBUG:1) uses same code as device stop/restart
      at runtime
    - save/restore most registers when calling other drivers


Version 0.91 -	 3/6-1997 - dsksl091.zip
    - expanded 'dsl -?'
    - corrected syntax errors

Version 0.90 -	 14/5-1997 - dsksl090.zip

    - Bugfix: changed start/stop code to work with HPFS386 (and other
      ring 0 I/O, too)
    - Bugfix: removed trap when no device were found to install for
    - IOCtl/bugfix: devices were stopped immediately when changing
      timeout from 0 to something higher
    - IOCtl/bugfix: correct timer value if no timeout
    - IOCtl/bugfix: return part of data if caller requests it
    - Display timeout values in driver output
    - updated dsksleep.doc (adapter and unit indices, dsl)


Version 0.86 -	 8/4-1997 - dsksl086.zip

    - Added regme.exe to archive
    - Extended dsl.exe to allow modifications of 'time left
      until stop' values
    - IOCtl to query version returns "registered" info
      and dsl.exe displays it
    - Corrected byte counts from IOCtls (not used in OS/2)
    - Modified DSKSleep.doc (includes HPFS386 warning)


Version 0.85 -	 5/3-1997 - dsksl085.zip

    - saves display messages for IOCtl
    - IOCtl to read saved messages, dsl.c modified
      to demonstrate this
    - TEST UNIT READY after START UNIT.  Errors from START UNIT
      are ignored, TEST UNIT READY has to complete successfully
      to allow further disk access.

Version 0.83 (internal)
    - long timeout for START UNIT (test -> permanent)
    - IOCtls to query/change timeout counters
    - Changed timeout values to seconds!

Version 0.82 (internal)
    - Corrected adapter numbering (now global)
    - REQUEST SENSE after START UNIT (test -> changed in 0.85)


Version 0.81 -  11/2-1997 - dsksl081.zip

    - fixed bug which caused any IOCtl to hang


Version 0.80 -  6/2-1997 - dsksl080.zip (never published)

    - IOCtls to allow applications to change timeout values and
      retrieve device list.  Included dsl.exe to demonstrate
      the IOCtls
    - Changed fidonet address


Version 0.70 - 3/11-1996 - dsksl070.zip

    - better Testmode (accesses disk and displays more
      status bytes on failure)
    - /!UT and /UT to change operation per device
    - History list starts...


Version 0.60 - dsksl060.zip

    - Testmode (/DEBUG:1) added
    - screen output cleaned (/DEBUG and /VERBOSE)
    - Dokumentation starts...


Version 0.50 - dsksl050.zip

    - first "public" release (some friends)
